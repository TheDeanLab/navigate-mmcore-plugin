**navigate-mmcore-plugin** is a plugin for navigate, a microscope control software.


**navigate-mmcore-plugin** enables users to access devices supported by the `Micro-Manager <https://micro-manager.org>`_
Core API (MMCore), greatly increasing the number of devices that can be controlled by
navigate.

.. note::

   This project is under active development. See our `GitHub repository for updates
   <https://github.com/TheDeanLab/navigate-mmcore-plugin>`_.

.. warning::

    Devices supported by the Micro-Manager Core API have not been tested
    by the Dean Lab. They are available for use at your own risk.
    If you encounter any issues, please report them on as an issue on GitHub.
    No warranty is provided for the use of this software.

.. warning::

    Please be advised that while the Dean Lab has implemented several safeguards in the
    automation of hardware, including but not limited to stage limits, voltage minimums,
    and maximums, are more, there are inherent risks associated with the use of such
    automated systems. Despite these precautions, the complexity and nature of automated
    hardware can lead to unpredictable outcomes. Therefore, the Dean Lab and UT
    Southwestern expressly disclaim any responsibility for any damages, losses, or
    injuries that may arise from or be related to the use of **navigate**.
